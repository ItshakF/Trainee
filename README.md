Hi and welcome on the Trainee Test.
To start to use the program start by copying the program into a new directory by typing : git clone https://github.com/ItshakF/Trainee.git.
next run npm i to install all packages.
Finally run ng serve -o
You can now see the program already open in your browser.

I have to say there are a lot of things that i didn't do. the reason for this is because I started the project only saturday night.
I have good reasons for starting that late and I hope you will take in consideration the fact that I would have done the project completely with an other delay.
Thanks.
